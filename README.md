# E01b-Smiles

This exercise teaches us how to create simple graphics using pthon and visual code.
First we need to edit main1.py to create a smily face then we need to open main2.py and 
use face_x and face_y to bring all the shapes used to create the smily face to the centre
and then use that experience to complete main3.py and main4.py. It was a great exercise
and I was unfortunately unable to do the extra credit main5.py but none the less the main5.py 
was really fun to experience.
